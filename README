When the game starts, shape outlines will start appearing on the screen
In the top right corner, you will see the current shape you can use
Place each shape as accurately as possible into a matching outline
Each time you do, you will get more time depending on your accuracy
When your time runs out, the game will end.

The color of the outline indicates the color of the shape you need to use
Use the 1,2,3,4 keys to use blue, red, green, and purple respectively

Press q and w to rotate your current shape left or right
Left-click to place the shape, there is no penalty to placing shapes

Ideas from Week 1
------------------------
We keep track of the game state with just an object (we didn't use function
Game() because we only need one game object). Each run of the game is managed
by its own Run object, which contains information such as where the player has
placed shapes, current time left, and total time played.

We used object inheritance to do shapes. There's a Shape base class with some
basic functions that every shape needs, and all shapes inherit from it, with
their own draw and compare functions.

We have mousemove, keypress, and click handlers. We also used canvas
transformations, text, and other simple canvas functions. There is also some
use of setTimeout and setInterval to do fading out animations, as well as timer
countdown.
